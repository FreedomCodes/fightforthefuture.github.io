                We’ve been fighting for your online security since before it was the hip thing to do. Long before Snowden, we mounted a massive resistance to smack down CISPA -- a bill that would have given agencies like the NSA even more power to invade your family’s privacy. Together with Demand Progress, we delivered over 300,000 signatures to Congress within 2 days after CISPA was reintroduced.

                ISP's and Hollywood came out to spy on and turn off people's Internet connection without due process in a program called Six Strikes. Corporate copyright holders, dismayed by their loss on SOPA legislation, went through a backdoor to get what they couldn't get from legislation. We called out their spying and abuse of monopoly power, and gave people a way to keep their private lives away from prying eyes by educating our members about <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/fftf">getting a VPN</a>.

                Telecom monopolies, defense contractors, and other corporate grinches were lobbying hard to pass CISPA. Its sponsor, Mike Rogers, claimed that no U.S. company opposed it -- so we organized the tech community and raised the Cat Signal with Craigslist, Reddit, Mozilla, Duck Duck Go, Imgur, 4chan and 30,000 other websites participating. And, after Mike Rogers tried to slam CISPA haters as “14-year-old tweeters”, we found one who would debate him.

Feeling the heat from the public outcry, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech companies dropped their support for CISPA.

Days later, a grand jury refused to indict, and Cam’s charges were dropped.

                The network we helped build with the StopWatching.Us coalition became all-important when an unexpected opportunity presented itself in the form of the Amash Amendment, which would have de-funded some of the NSA’s programs. In two days, we drove tens of thousands of calls to congress and brought the amendment within 6 votes of passing. The media went nuts, and members of Congress knew that change was inevitable.

We debuted it in style by projecting it onto the side of a huge building in Manhattan with hundreds of Internet freedom supporters turning out to watch the unveiling and to stand up against the NSA.
