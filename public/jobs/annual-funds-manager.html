	<p><strong>Compensation.</strong> Market Rate / Commensurate with Experience</p>

	<p><strong>Location.</strong> The team will be 100% remote-&mdash;no need to commute or relocate. If you&#x27;re interested in relocation, let us know. We&rsquo;d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.</p>
	
		<p><strong>To apply:</strong> If you&rsquo;re interested, send links to work you&rsquo;ve done to <a href="mailto:tycheng+funds@gmail.com">tycheng+funds@gmail.com</a>. Show us that you excel at the things we&rsquo;re looking for.  If you like, include links to or samples of your writing&ndash;ideally in situations where you&rsquo;re writing to persuade a group of people to. Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you&rsquo;ve done, projects you&rsquo;ve worked on, etc.  Being well-rounded is a plus, so don&rsquo;t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren&rsquo;t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).</p>
	
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> we expect this job announcement to reach a lot of people who are very politically active, but who may not be sold on the significance of this particular cause.  So here&rsquo;s a quick summary of how we see the threat and the opportunity:</p>
	
		<p>First, technology is increasingly the foundation for social participation and the pursuit of justice. We depend on a combination of software, devices, and the internet to get news, read books, organize others&mdash; a slew of essential activities.  Second, digital technology contains a basic social justice: once something gets made, it costs relatively little to give everyone access.</p>
	
		<p>This means two things: 1) to preserve our existing freedoms and institutions we have to fight to keep their technological underpinnings free from interference. 2) If we&rsquo;re successful we win much more than that: a world where everyone has equal access to many of humanity&rsquo;s most valuable creations (knowledge, cultural expression, and the digital tools to make more).</p>
	
		<p>There are several excellent organizations working on the same set of issues; we can be very effective working in collaboration with them by focusing on public-facing campaigns and employing a different mix of tactics. The organization&rsquo;s founding team also has an interesting track record in doing just this.</p>
