	<p>Fight for the Future is dedicated to expanding the Internet's transformative power for good. Our goal: to build a grassroots movement to ensure that everyone can access the Internet’s many resources affordably, free of interference or censorship and with full privacy. Our vision: a world where everyone can enjoy the basic freedom to express, create and connect online.</p>
	
</br>
	
		<p>Our organization is nimble and can react quickly to current events, and our staff is a unique combination of talented technologists, educators, organizers, advocates and artists. Working with our many allies in the non-profit and tech sectors, we launch campaigns that frequently go viral and engage virtually every demographic. We frame our messages in ways that make people understand and care about even the most technical issue. We also provide them with online tools that make it easy and compelling to take action and share with friends.</p>
		
		</br>
		
		<img src="../aboutus/theory.png" style="float:left">
		
				<p>We believe that we can turn Internet users around the world into empowered and informed agents for change. By bringing individuals together so that they identify as a unified Internet constituency, and by providing them with the tools to amplify their collective voice we know that the best outcome will prevail in any policy debate.</p>
				
				</br>
				
		<img src="../aboutus/issues.png" style="float:left">
		
		<p>We view the following as the major threats to freedom of expression online: </p>
	
		
		
		<ul>	
			<li> <strong>Copyright and patent laws are outdated and overzealous.</strong> They hurt artists and innovation, shifting control of our art, media, and ideas to large corporations.</li>
			<li> <strong>Slow speed and limited access:</strong> Lack of competition in the U.S. broadband market has resulted in an Internet system that is among the slowest, most expensive and least available among developed nations.   </li>
					<a name="impact" href="#"></a>
				<li> <strong>Tracking and Spying: </strong>People can’t express themselves freely online when they feel like they are being watched. In an extreme form, government and corporate surveillance can lead to political repression.</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		</br>
		
		
		<img src="../aboutus/impact.png" style="float:left">
		
		<p>Fight for the Future is known for its powerful and massive viral organizing campaigns that have changed Internet history both nationally and globally. Under a campaign to stop SOPA and PIPA — the largest and most visible online protest in history — hundreds of thousands of websites, including sites like Google, Craigslist and Wikipedia, joined the protest by going dark or prominently displaying info on the bills. Ultimately, 24 million people took action against bad tech policy, and both bills were shelved.</p>
		
		<p>Our SOPA strike inspired street protests across Europe against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) — another attack on digital rights — and led to ACTA’s historic defeat. In 2012, we also helped to stall out the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) written ostensibly to prevent threats to cybersecurity, but written so broadly that it could easily be used for government spying and censorship. For the last election, we created a slate of voter registration and get-out-the-vote apps which gave the grassroots access to the tools that typically only large presidential campaigns can afford, diluting the power and influence of SuperPACs. And last November, public outcry from our campaign contributed to the rejection of a treaty that would have moved Internet governance to a top-down United Nations agency that operates behind closed doors and under corporate influence.</p>
