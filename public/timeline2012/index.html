	<h1>When we set out a year ago, no one could have imagined that in 2012, 24 million Internet users would emerge as THE political force to be reckoned with.  Check out this impressive list of wins!</h1>

	<div class="info"><p><strong>FFTF launches first campaign: <a href="http://www.freebieber.org" target="self">FreeBieber.org</a> to stop Senate bill 978.</strong>The bill would have made it a felony to post YouTube cover songs, with up to five years in prison. The campaign prompts 200,000 petition signers, 50,000 Facebook likes, coverage in hundreds of news and blog articles, including <a href="http://www.fightforthefuture.org/colbert-sopa/">the Colbert Report</a>, and the outcry of Justin Bieber himself. The ‘Bieber Bill,’ as it soon came to be known, was never voted on..</p>

	<div class="info"><p><strong><a href="http://americancensorship.org" target="self">American Censorship Day</a> is held on the date of the first SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) hearing.</strong> The bill, together with the Senate’s Protect-IP Act (PIPA) faced minimal public resistance despite the fact that they could be used to censor or shut down any website. In protest, over 6,000 websites agree to use our "stop SOPA censorship" widget to black out their logo. The campaign generated over two million petition signers, one million emails and 84,000 calls to Congress.</p>
