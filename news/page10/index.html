        <span class="date">Posted 11:12 EDT on November 4, 2016</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1399" data-orig-width="2048"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/ece97ce07c3af2b60d8f08f741b02015/tumblr_inline_og4i5aK5KR1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1399" data-orig-width="2048"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, November 4, 2016<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, (978) 852-6457<br/><br/>PITTSBURGH, PA––Hundreds packed into Mr Smalls Theater in Pittsburgh last night to protest the anti-democratic Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement at the “Rock Against the TPP” concert headlined by legendary political punk band Anti-Flag. The event was part of a nationwide tour featuring high profile musicians and celebrities raising awareness about controversial deal, which is expected to come up for a vote in Congress during the “lame duck” session after the election.<br/></p><p><b>See PHOTOS of the event available for use by press here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/I9RrK" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/I9RrK</a> </b></p><p><b>See a short VIDEO from the finale of the event here: <a href="https://youtu.be/p8ngUeInoKw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/p8ngUeInoKw</a> </b></p><p>The concert also featured renowned Pittsburgh folksinger Anne Feeney along with Downtown Boys, Taina Asili, Ryan Harvey, Son of Nun, </p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. </p><p>Anti-Flag are one of the most popular musical acts to emerge from Pittsburgh, and tour extensively performing politically charged punk rock that’s half circle pit, half picket line. The band issued the following statement ahead of the November 3rd concert: &ldquo;The Rock Against The TPP shows that we have played across the US and Canada were so amazing that we had to curate one in our beloved hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - Pittsburgh, an international epicenter of the labor movement  - a city where union loyalty and the fight for human rights courses through the veins of its citizens to this very day. The Rock Against The TPP shows are beyond educational, they&rsquo;re inspirational. They are a true testament to music&rsquo;s ability to bring people together and create positive change; a rally to energize us all to continue to fight against The TPP and all of the ills it will bring to the world.&rdquo;</p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, “we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>Organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future in partnership with legendary guitarist Tom Morello (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer Ryan Harvey’s record label Firebrand Records, previous stops on the Rock Against the TPP tour have featured high-profile participants including actress Evangeline Lilly, hip hop icon Talib Kweli, comedian Hari Kondabolu, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, legendary punk band Anti-Flag, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation Chumbawamba, and ANTI records songwriter Jolie Holland. The roadshow has already drawn <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WMeQZ" target="_blank">large crowds</a> in Denver, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Toronto.</p><p>The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers. The Pittsburgh stop was also backed by the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, PA Fair Trade Coalition, and Fight Back Pittsburgh.</p><p>For Interviews with artists or organizers, please contact Evan Greer at <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or (978) 852-6457.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p># # #</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-10-27-one-year-after-hitting-100k-signatures-obama/">One year after hitting 100k signatures, Obama still hasn’t responded to the “We the People” petition asking him to support strong encryption.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:07 EDT on October 27, 2016</span>


        <p>One year ago, the “We the People” <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/publicly-affirm-your-support-strong-encryption" target="_blank">petition</a> calling on President Obama to stand for strong encryption reached the 100,000 signature threshold that is supposed to trigger a response from the President. We never heard from him.</p><p>Today—one year later—Fight for the Future and 17 other groups are once again calling on the President to acknowledge and respond to the 100,000+ people that signed this petition. President Obama and the incoming president have a responsibility to 
defend online security for everyone. We need to know where they stand on
 this important issue.<br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Dear President Obama,</p><p>On September 29, 2015, Access Now, EFF, and a coalition that grew to nearly 50 organizations and companies initiated a petition using your “We the People” platform. The petition asked you to “[p]ublicly affirm your support for strong encryption,” and to “[r]eject any law, policy, or mandate that would undermine our security” online. It also asked you to encourage other governments worldwide  to do the same. The petition, also available at SaveCrypto.org, garnered more than 100,000 signatures in fewer than 30 days.</p><p>According to the blog post announcing the creation of We The People, “if a petition gathers enough online signatures, it will be reviewed by policy experts and you’ll receive an official response.” At the time our petition was submitted the threshold for official response was (and currently is) 100,000 signatures within 30 days. Further, the website pledges an official response within 60 days of meeting that threshold.</p><p>It has been 365 days — a full year — since our petition exceeded 100,000 signatures, and while in December 2015 your administration created an online portal for signatories to offer more information, there has still been no substantive response. </p><p>Encryption tools enable journalists, whistleblowers, organizers, and regular people to communicate securely. It assures users of the integrity of their data and authenticates individuals to companies, governments, and one another. Further, the ability to confidently communicate and conduct business online is a necessary foundation of economic growth in the digital age. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression recently noted, “[e]ncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief.” </p><p>In the 365 days since our petition hit the 100,000 signatory threshold to ensure a response from the administration, the FBI attempted to force Apple to build an entirely new, insecure operating system to bypass its security protocols and the U.S. Congress and legislatures in individual states have debated passing harmful anti-security legislation that would endanger the technology sector globally. Around the world, governments have capitalized on the lack of leadership in support for encryption and implemented harmful laws and policies. China specifically cited to the rhetoric in the U.S. last December when it passed a new law that likely bans end to end encryption, with no upper limit on fines for non-compliant companies. The UK is on the cusp of passing a law that could, practically, have the same impact. And from Brazil to Russia to India we are seeing other actions or proposals that could undermine the security of the global internet. </p><p>Mr. President, your response is urgently needed to clarify the United States’ position and establish its leadership on this critically important topic. The United States should once and for all repudiate any type of mandate requiring third-party access to encrypted data, both stored and in transit.</p><p>The leading candidates for president have commented on the importance of strengthening U.S. cybersecurity. A cornerstone to those plans must be an increase in the development and use of strong encryption. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Access Now</p><p>Advocacy for Principled Action in Government</p><p>American Library Association</p><p>Amnesty International</p><p>Center for Media Justice</p><p>Consumer Technology Association (CTA)</p><p>Constitutional Alliance</p><p>Electronic Frontier Foundation</p><p>Free Press</p><p>Freedom of the Press Foundation</p><p>Fight For the Future</p><p>Global Network Initiative</p><p>Human Rights Watch</p><p>New America&rsquo;s Open Technology Institute</p><p>Niskanen Center</p><p>OpenTheGovernment.org</p><p>Restore the Fourth</p><p>World Privacy Forum</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:00 EDT on October 25, 2016</span>


        <h2><i>Fight for the Future statement in response to report detailing AT&amp;T’s massive secret surveillance program, paid for with taxpayer money</i></h2><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Today, it was <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/25/at-t-is-spying-on-americans-for-profit.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that AT&amp;T has been running a massive secret spying program—funded by tens of millions in taxpayer money—for state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct warrantless searches of trillions of call records and other extremely sensitive customer data such as precise physical location. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a digital rights group known for its high profile campaigns for free speech and online security, released the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:<br/></p><p>“The for-profit spying program that these documents detail is more terrifying than the illegal NSA surveillance programs that Edward Snowden exposed. Far beyond the NSA and FBI, these tools are accessible to a wide range of law enforcement officers including local police, without a warrant, as long as they pay up. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it. Customers trusted AT&amp;T with some of their most private information, and the company turned around and literally built a product to sell that information to as many government agencies and police departments as they could. Not only did they fail to have any safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of the data, they actually required law enforcement to keep the program secret and dig up or fabricate other evidence, to hide the fact that they’d received information from AT&amp;T. If companies are allowed to operate in this manner without repercussions, our democracy has no future. We call on AT&amp;T to immediately shut down this illegal and unethical spying program, and we demand that the U.S. department of Justice launch an investigation into the use of the Hemisphere spying program, and reveal all court cases where Hemisphere was used so that they can be reviewed.”</p><p>Fight for the Future is best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history including the massive SOPA Blackout, the Internet Slowdown for net neutrality, and Reset the Net opposing mass government surveillance.
