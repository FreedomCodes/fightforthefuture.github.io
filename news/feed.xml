        <title>UPDATE: Massive protest for net neutrality spreads across the Internet</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;713&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;1357&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://68.media.tumblr.com/eea02c4afd6799a15e47559f1e434ee2/tumblr_inline_oszpcmyZlK1ri3xd7_540.png&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;713&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;1357&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, July 12, 2017&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than 100,000  websites, Internet users, and organizations are participating in a massive online protest against the FCC’s plan to gut protections that keep the web free from censorship, throttling, and extra fees. Protesters have also gathered outside the Senate in DC.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the most popular websites on the web are participating in an Internet-Wide &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Day of Action&lt;/a&gt; to Save Net Neutrality today to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal foundation for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Starting at midnight, a flood of major web platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, Amazon, Mozilla, OK Cupid, Vimeo, Pornhub, Imgur, and Soundcloud began displaying prominent protest messages to their users, encouraging them to take action by contacting the FCC and Congress through tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BattleForTheNet.com&lt;/a&gt; that make it easy for Internet users to make their voices heard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See PHOTOS, IMAGES, and DESCRIPTIONS of how participants are protesting here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/vYVet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://imgur.com/a/vYVet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embed a video about the day of action here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcIFBb3e3tFA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;amp;t=MGY2YThjMzU5MTMyMWQzMzEwNmVkYzk4ZmUyODViZTBmMDA1NzgxZixBdTdLV0dLRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.fightforthefuture.org%2Fpost%2F162821217028%2Flargest-websites-on-earth-prepare-for-net&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIFBb3e3tFA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More highlights in this Twitter moment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments/885130181039579136&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/i/moments/885130181039579136&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the leading groups behind the protest, issued the following statement (pronouns: she/hers): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Today is a historic moment when the Internet is realizing it’s power. We’re massive amounts of creativity and action coming from every corner of the Internet, from the smallest and weirdest nooks and crannies of the web to the most popular websites on earth. And this doesn’t end today &amp;ndash; this protest is the kickoff of a sustained campaign to keep the pressure on lawmakers and the FCC to do the right thing. This is our opening salvo, and it’s a massive one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The FCC needs to listen to the public, not just lobbyists from big cable companies. Today, the Internet is showing its political power. No one wants companies like Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon to have control over what we can see and do online, or to have to pay them extra fees to access the content we want. The Internet is outraged by censorship and corruption, this is our moment to to defend net neutrality and fight for the future of freedom of expression.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lawmakers in Washington, DC need to understand that if they stand idly by and allow the FCC to gut these rules that are overwhelmingly supported by voters from across the political spectrum, they will be seen as enemies of the Internet and enemies of free speech.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;480&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://68.media.tumblr.com/1d2d99b4cdc180fb589fe7f674100b44/tumblr_inline_oszpd6HBJG1ri3xd7_540.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;480&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100,000 people, sites, and organizations signed up to participate the effort ahead of the 12th, and many times that will have joined in by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/infographic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Slowdown&lt;/a&gt;. Media attention for online mobilizations tends to focus on the big names participating, but there is a much more interesting story: a coalition of Internet activists huddled over their laptops in coworking spaces, home offices, and coffee shops, who are the ones who came up with the idea, called for, and organized the protest, and have since been working together to lay the groundwork, build the technical tools, and create the educational resources that make it possible for large and small websites to participate in these mass days of action. It’s a grassroots effort involving dozens of volunteers working together in Slack channels, outreach spreadsheets, endless email chains, organizing in online communities and forums, and an enormous amount of creativity and digital elbow grease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;928&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;1604&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://68.media.tumblr.com/20d443c348116b62168ec81dbb8bb7e2/tumblr_inline_oszpdo9Wd11ri3xd7_540.png&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;928&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;1604&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of sites and apps participating has grown so quickly it’s almost impossible to keep up, but participants include Automattic (Wordpress), eBay, Rosetta Stone, Pinterest, Amazon, Mozilla, Netflix, Etsy, Kickstarter, Soundcloud, Dropbox, Spotify, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Medium, Y Combinator, GitHub, Pantheon, Opera, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Stack Overflow, Funny Or Die, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, SlashDot, Dribble, Dischord, SourceForge, and Union Square Ventures.

You can come up something creative about how the Internet will suffer if Big Cable gets to slow down or block sites, but here are some samples you can use for inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Stop the FCC’s plan for throttling, blocking, &amp;amp; new fees online. Take action now to defend #NetNeutrality: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. We deserve equal access to the internet &amp;amp; the FCC is trying to take that away. Act now to save #NetNeutrality: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. This tweet is being ████ by Comcast. Well, not yet. But, only if you ████ stop them: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. This tweet is being ████ by your internet service provider. Well, not yet. But, only if you ████ stop them: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. #NetNeutrality preserves the freedom of information we all enjoy online. Say no to internet censorship: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. #NetNeutrality stops internet service providers from charging extra fees. Let’s save it! Take action now: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. #NetNeutrality stops Comcast &amp;amp; Verizon from charging extra fees. Let’s save it! Take action now: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.  If you’re reading this, you have to act now to defend the free and open Internet. Submit your comment to the FCC at BattlefortheNet.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.  ISPs like @Comcast want 🇺🇸 to let them 🐢 the Internet for 💰. But we can 🛑 them: Battleforthenet.com #NetNeutrality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.  #NetNeutrality is the First Amendment of the internet. Take action now to stop Big Cable from destroying it: battleforthenet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use our video bumper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F223515967&amp;amp;t=NTcxZDgzODQ4ZjBiMzI5ZWU1NWFmZTYzZjc0OTU4YTU0ZjE5M2Q0MyxBWVBuS3M2Rg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AYQASxsD1vq-mDlMoCKwRMQ&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffftf-staff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F162872739994%2Fheres-how-you-can-participate-in-net-neutrality&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;short video reel&lt;/a&gt; that explains why net neutrality matters, and how Internet users can tell the FCC and Congress to protect the open web at all costs through BattleForTheNet.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are square, vertical, and horizontal versions of the bumper &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F0B7iKho2OIeVzY1FKTlAzS1NOVTg&amp;amp;t=YzdiMWQ4Yjk5MThlOWRkNzEzYTU0M2Y5N2E1ZDZkZTdlODJkNGU0MCxBWVBuS3M2Rg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AYQASxsD1vq-mDlMoCKwRMQ&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffftf-staff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F162872739994%2Fheres-how-you-can-participate-in-net-neutrality&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;for you to download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this reel to your online creations on or before July 12.

The goal of the protest tomorrow is to ensure that ordinary people have a voice and are heard by decision makers in Washington, DC.  No one &amp;ndash; regardless of their political affiliation &amp;ndash; wants their cable company to control what they can see and do on the Internet, or to charge extra fees to access the content they want,” &lt;strong&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the leading organizations behind the protest,&lt;/strong&gt; “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and that transformative power is worth fighting for. July 12th we will come together to defend the future of free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media attention for online mobilizations tends to focus on the big names participating, but there is a much more interesting story: a rag tag coalition of Internet activists huddled over their laptops in coworking spaces, home offices, and coffee shops, who are the ones who came up with the idea, called for, and organized the protest, and have since been working together to lay the groundwork, build the technical tools, and create the educational resources that make it possible for large and small websites to participate in these mass days of action. It’s a grassroots effort involving dozens of volunteers working together in Slack channels, outreach spreadsheets, endless email chains, organizing in online communities and forums, and an enormous amount of creativity and digital elbow grease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed on to the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Participants will display prominent messages on their homepages on July 12 or encourage users to take action in other ways, using push notifications, videos, social media, and emails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sites and apps participating include Automattic (Wordpress), Soundcloud, Medium, Y Combinator, GitHub, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Stack Overflow, Funny Or Die, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, SlashDot, Dribble, Change.org, Dischord, SourceForge, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association, Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Free Software Foundation, Internet Creators Guild, the Women’s March, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>100+ high-profile online creators sign open letter to FCC and Congress opposing plans to gut net neutrality</title>

In an &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internetcreatorsguild.com/net-neutrality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;released today, creators warn that if the FCC slashes Title II – the strong legal foundation for U.S. net neutrality protections – the impacts of allowing Internet service providers to block, throttle, and charge fees would be immense for online video creators, many of whose audiences rival traditional media in size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, organized by the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internetcreatorsguild.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Creators Guild&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; highlights the skyrocketing popularity in video traffic over the past decade, and warns that any weakening of the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order “&amp;hellip;would have an outsized impact on our field and jeopardize our livelihood.” The letter&amp;rsquo;s signatories, who collectively reach over 165 million people in their audiences, worry that a loss of net neutrality will give Internet service providers (ISPs) new influence over how online creators are able to grow their businesses. They argue that these protections are crucial to maintaining a level playing field. The organizers are encouraging more people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/fightforthefuture.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv_XFI8M_OCm7iiL70CpaGqNqDVC1FPU0JoMdA0SW43kRaEA/viewform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sign on&lt;/a&gt;, as names are being added on rolling basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notable signatories include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

Over 50,000 people and thousands of websites have already joined the online protest, including web giants such as Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OkCupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and many others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signatories plan to leverage their online reach to encourage their audiences and the American to speak out for strong net neutrality protections. The letter states, “We’re in this for the long-haul. We will fight for as long as it takes to convince you and your colleagues to oppose any legislation or regulatory changes that would threaten real, enforceable Title II net neutrality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laura Chernikoff, Executive Director of the Internet Creators Guild, said:&lt;/b&gt; “Online creators and the American public have made their position loud and clear: we need real, enforceable net neutrality rules rooted in Title II of the Communications Act. This is the only way to ensure each of us can continue to live in a country where Internet users have an equal shot at reaching people and earning a living on the open web.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hank Green, Internet Creators Guild Advisor and creator of Vlogbrothers, SciShow, and CrashCourse said, &lt;/b&gt;“So many individuals and corporations have been given such tremendous economic opportunities thanks to a neutral internet. I am one of them, and it hurts to think the opportunities I&amp;rsquo;ve had might be denied to other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This action is part of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internetcreatorsguild.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Creators Guild’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;efforts to advocate for and support creators. The non-profit organization was created in order to bring internet creators together to make their profession more sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTACT INFORMATION:&lt;br/&gt;Laura Chernikoff&lt;br/&gt;Executive Director, Internet Creators Guild&lt;br/&gt;+1-303-819-873&lt;br/&gt;laura@internetcreatorsguild.com&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Other participants include Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OK Cupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and PornHub&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban Dictionary, Bandcamp, Automattic (who run WordPress) and Discord are among latest major web platforms to join the Internet-Wide &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Day of Action&lt;/a&gt; to Save Net Neutrality scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal foundation for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Vimeo, Private Internet Access, Mozilla, OK Cupid, Imgur, PornHub, Medium, and dozens of other major sites are also participating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed on to the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Participants will display prominent messages on their homepages on July 12 or encourage users to take action in other ways, using push notifications, videos, social media, and emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the announcement for the day of action here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://battleforthenet.com/july12&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See examples of what sites are doing on July 12 here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12#join&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12#join&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sites and apps participating include Soundcloud, Medium, Y Combinator, GitHub, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Stack Overflow, Funny Or Die, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, SlashDot, Dribble, Dischord, SourceForge, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association, Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Free Software Foundation, Internet Creators Guild, the Women’s March, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:&lt;/b&gt; “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &amp;ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said:&lt;/b&gt; “A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&amp;rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &amp;ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&amp;rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said:&lt;/b&gt; “Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said: &lt;/b&gt;“The FCC&amp;rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said: &lt;/b&gt;“It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&amp;rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&amp;rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&amp;rsquo;d put both us and our customers&amp;rsquo; innovation at risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s only right that lawmakers are now stepping in and calling for an investigation. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regardless of their views on the FCC’s proceeding, every member of Congress should be concerned if their constituents’ identities are being stolen and used to submit comments to a Federal Agency without their permission, in ways that violate federal law and the privacy rights of the individuals affected.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The public needs to know who has been attempting to distort the record with these fraudulent comments, whether they were funded by the telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s attack on net neutrality protections, and whether leadership at the FCC knew about the operation and willfully decided to allow it to continue.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Federal Agencies have a responsibility to employ basic cybersecurity practices and act transparently to ensure that public comment proceedings have integrity and allow for meaningful input from the public. At this point, the FCC has clearly failed to maintain that integrity in this latest net neutrality proceeding. Members of Congress should work across the aisle to ensure that the agency addresses these serious cybersecurity issues before moving forward with an unpopular plan to dismantle consumer protections”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is also one of the main organizations behind the massive July 12 Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which has attracted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a wide range of prominent supporters including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, Reddit, Pornhub, Soundcloud, and Vimeo. The group has been a leading voice calling for transparency and investigations into cybersecurity issues as the FCC for several months, and has compiled &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;significant evidence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of what appears to be a sophisticated astroturfing organization that is attempting to create the false impression of grassroots opposition to net neutrality protections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history including the SOPA Blackout, Internet Slowdown, Reset the Net, and Rock Against the TPP.

        <title>FCC’s response to inquiries about alleged DDoS attack raises more questions than answers</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 26, 2017&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why wasn’t the agency using basic protection that could have prevented alleged cyber attacks that silenced pro-net neutrality voices?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9t2hnplz4-aS3plM1RRQ0t2ZlUwWTRyTVhta0ZDVDZRU1lJ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;has responded&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a letter from Senators Wyden and Schatz requesting more information about an alleged DDoS attack that took down the agency’s comment system immediately following John Oliver’s viral segment about net neutrality, during a time when large numbers of concerned citizens were attempting to register their support for Title II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC’s response, however, raises more questions than answers. The agency’s explanation of the attack makes it seem as if they have not yet identified or taken steps to address the bottlenecks or flaws in their architecture to prevent their system from collapsing at another critical moment. It’s the responsibility of anyone running an important site like the FCC’s electronic comment filing system to employ basic cybersecurity practices that prevent abuse and outages, including the ability to block malicious traffic by IP address, and simple scaling strategies, like caching slow database queries. The agency also claims the attacks came from “cloud providers.” &lt;b&gt;If this is the case, cloud providers keep records of the exact resources used by each account for billing purposes. Why hasn’t the FCC employed legal means to identify who allegedly attacked their systems? And why haven’t they used the same legal means to attempt to identify the attacker that is submitting hundreds of thousands of fraudulent comments using stolen identities, in violation of federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1001)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the FCC failed to take basic steps to prevent these alleged DDoS attacks &amp;ndash; as well as the widely reported flood of fake anti-net neutrality comments, have refused to release information that would assist in an investigation into who is behind them, and have failed to take steps to prevents something like this from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ajit Pai and the FCC are blatantly trying to sweep this under the rug, so I’m not surprised that they issued their response on a Friday afternoon, hoping that it would go unnoticed,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“But the fact remains that large numbers of people were prevented from voicing their legitimate concerns about the agency’s plan to dismantle net neutrality protections, while at the same time they have refused to do anything about the massive number of fake anti-net neutrality comments that have been submitted using stolen names and addresses. The agency must address these serious issues before moving forward, or it is making it clear that it has lost all legitimacy and is simply working on behalf of the very companies that it is supposed to be protecting consumers from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress also responded to Ajit Pai’s letter with additional questions for the agency. See their response&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-and-ogr-dem-leaders-raise-alarms-about-alleged-cyberattack-that-blocked&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Net Neutrality Day of Action Gets Another Huge Boost as Twitter, Soundcloud, Twilio, and Medium join protest</title>

Other participants include Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OK Cupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and PornHub&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Twilio, Plays.tv, and Adblock are among latest major web platforms to join the Internet-Wide &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day of Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Save Net Neutrality scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal framework for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Companies participating will display prominent messages on their homepages on July 12 or encourage users to take action in other ways, like through push notifications and emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum comes against the backdrop of a recent Morning Consult / POLITICO poll &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-shows-broad-bipartisan-support-net-neutrality-rules/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that shows&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;broad bipartisan support for net neutrality rules. “This protest is gaining so much momentum because no one wants their cable company to charge them extra fees or have the power to control what they can see and do on the Internet,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“Congress and the FCC need to listen to the public, not just lobbyists. The goal of this day of action is to make them listen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed up to participate in the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Many popular online personalities including YouTuber &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhillyD/status/872200755020578816&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Philip DeFranco&lt;/a&gt;, and dozens of major online forums and subreddits have also announced their participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the announcement for the day of action here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://battleforthenet.com/july12&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies participating include Amazon, Netflix, OK Cupid, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, Y Combinator, GitHub, Private Internet Access, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Patreon, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Imgur, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Brave, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, Discourse, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association,  Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Internet Creators Guild, and many others. &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/july12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the full list here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:&lt;/b&gt; “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &amp;ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: &lt;/b&gt;“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&amp;rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &amp;ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&amp;rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said: &lt;/b&gt;“Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said:&lt;/b&gt; “The FCC&amp;rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:&lt;/b&gt; “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&amp;rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&amp;rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&amp;rsquo;d put both us and our customers&amp;rsquo; innovation at risk.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>More than 15,000 people call on the FCC to remove and investigate fake anti-net neutrality comments using stolen names and addresses</title>

I have been slandered,” &lt;b&gt;Joel Mullaney, a software engineer who supports net neutrality, told Fight for the Future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the public requests from victims calling for the FCC to remove the fake comments, supported by mounting evidence [1][2][3][4], Chairman Ajit Pai and the FCC have taken no steps to remove them from the docket, risking the safety and privacy of potentially hundreds of thousands of people [5].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person or organization has been using stolen names and addresses to fraudulently file comments opposing net neutrality,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. “Chairman Pai is completely undermining the public’s faith in the FCC and the current public debate about net neutrality protections. The agency has an obligation to remove falsified statements in its procedure and to publicly disclose whatever information it has about who is behind this,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people agree, having signed &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-the-fcc-remove-fake-comments-immediately-and-call-for-an-investigation-by-the-appropriate-authorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; t&lt;/b&gt;hat echoes the demands of victims and calls for the FCC to take the following actions: “[1] Notify all who have been impacted by this attack, [2] remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately, [3] publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments, and [4] call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“Making false statements”) and other relevant laws.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future has launched &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comcastroturf.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comcastroturf.com&lt;/a&gt; f&lt;/b&gt;or Internet users to find out if a fake anti-net neutrality comment was submitted to the FCC in their name and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the person or organization behind this attack. Further, we encourage journalists to ask ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1]&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;[3]&lt;a href=&quot;http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/&lt;/a&gt; [4]&lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[5] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:&lt;/b&gt; “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &amp;ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: &lt;/b&gt;“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&amp;rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &amp;ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&amp;rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said: &lt;/b&gt;“Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said:&lt;/b&gt; “The FCC&amp;rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:&lt;/b&gt; “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&amp;rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&amp;rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&amp;rsquo;d put both us and our customers&amp;rsquo; innovation at risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Victims whose stolen names and addresses were used to submit fake anti-net neutrality comments send letter to FCC demanding investigation</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, May 25, 2017&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt; FCC must investigate and disclose any information about who is behind fake comments that posted people’s personal information into the FCC’s public docket without their permission. So far the agency has done nothing, and says they will count the fake comments as if they are real.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victims of a campaign that spammed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with over 450,000 fake anti-net neutrality comments have sent a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai asking him to remove the fraudulent comments from the public docket and demanding an investigation into who is behind the identity theft.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whoever is behind this stole our names and addresses, exposed our private information in a public docket without our permission, and used our identities to file a political statement we did not sign onto,” the letter reads. The letter also warns that “hundreds of thousands of other Americans may have been victimized too.” &lt;b&gt;See the full letter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-25-letter-to-the-fcc-from-people-whose-names-and/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the launch of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comcastroturf.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comcastroturf.com&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; a site encouraging Internet users to investigate the fake comments, Fight for the Future received dozens of verified reports from impacted people across the country. More than 2,400 people have also used the site to contact their state Attorneys General, calling for an investigation. (Separately, Fight for the Future &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-23-comcast-tries-to-censor-pro-net-neutrality-website/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;also received&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a baseless “Cease and Desist” letter from Comcast attempting to censor Comcastroturf.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three separate reports came from friends of recently-deceased individuals who confirmed their friends could not have posted the comments posthumously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In my nearly 30 years of being an Internet user, I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely judicious about using my real name online. On those rare times when I have chosen to do so, it&amp;rsquo;s been for something I feel strongly about. To see my good name used to present an opinion diametrically opposed to my own view on Net Neutrality makes me feel sad and violated,” &lt;b&gt;Joel Mullaney told Fight for the Future. &lt;/b&gt;“Whoever did this violated one of the most basic norms of our democratic society, that each of us have our own voice, and I am eager to know from what source the FCC obtained this falsified affidavit. I have been slandered,”&lt;b&gt; Mr. Mullaney added.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although much evidence of this identity theft has been documented by concerned citizens, experts, media outlets, and organizations like Fight for the Future, [1][2][3][4] Chairman Pai and the FCC have taken no steps to remove them from the docket, risking the safety and privacy of potentially hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter to Chairman Pai calls for the FCC to take the following actions: “[1] Notify all who have been impacted by this attack, [2] remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately, [3] publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments, and [4] call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“Making false statements”) and other relevant laws.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “There is significant evidence that a person or organization has been using stolen names and addresses to fraudulently file comments opposing net neutrality,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. “For the FCC’s process to have any legitimacy, they simply cannot move forward until an investigation has been conducted. We need to know who is doing this,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the person or organization behind this attack. Further, we encourage journalists to ask ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is asking for all victims of this attack to email them with a report: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;team@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3] &lt;a href=&quot;http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4] &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Letter to the FCC from people whose names and addresses were used to submit fake comments against net neutrality</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;May 25, 2017&lt;br/&gt;The Honorable Ajit Pai&lt;br/&gt;Chairman&lt;br/&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;br/&gt;445 12th Street, S.W.&lt;br/&gt;Washington, D.C. 20554 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. David A. Bray&lt;br/&gt;Chief Information Officer&lt;br/&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;br/&gt;445 12th Street, S.W.&lt;br/&gt;Washington, D.C. 20554&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CC Members of U.S. Congress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Chairman Pai,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our names and personal information were used to file comments we did not make to the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are disturbed by reports that indicate you have no plans [1] to remove these fraudulent comments from the public docket. Whoever is behind this stole our names and addresses, publicly exposed our private information without our permission, and used our identities to file a political statement we did not sign onto. Hundreds of thousands of other Americans may have been victimized too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We call on you, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to take the following actions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notify all who have been impacted by this attack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“making false statements”) and other relevant laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; As chairman of the FCC, an independent federal agency, it is your responsibility to maintain public trust, especially while your agency is fielding comments on the future of the free and open Internet, an issue that millions of Americans care deeply about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on numerous media reports [2], nearly half a million Americans may have been impacted by whoever impersonated us in a dishonest and deceitful campaign to manufacture false support for your plan to repeal net neutrality protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may be convenient for you to ignore this, given that it was done in an attempt to support your position, it cannot be the case that the FCC moves forward on such a major public debate without properly investigating this known attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All proper authorities must be notified immediately and the FCC must disclose any and all information the agency has pertaining to the organization or person behind these fake comments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittany Ainsworth, Huntington Beach, CA&lt;br/&gt;Greg Baynes, View Park, CA,&lt;br/&gt;William Brahams, San Bernardino, CA&lt;br/&gt;Christian Brown, Redondo Beach, CA&lt;br/&gt;John Burr, New York, NY&lt;br/&gt;Angelica Collins, Bear, DE&lt;br/&gt;Megan Conschafter, Buffalo, NY&lt;br/&gt;Ben Currier, Littleton, CO&lt;br/&gt;Norman Daoust, Cambridge, MA&lt;br/&gt;Cynthia Duby, Desert Hot Springs, CA&lt;br/&gt;Aaron Francis, Santa Ana, CA&lt;br/&gt;Michelle Ellett, Benicia, CA&lt;br/&gt;Adam Galatioto, Gainesville, FL&lt;br/&gt;Surbhi Godsay, Nashua, NH&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Hickey, Worcester, MA&lt;br/&gt;Richard O.

        <title>Comcast tries to censor pro-net neutrality website calling for investigation of fake FCC comments potentially funded by cable lobby</title>

Without net neutrality rules, Comcast could have censored the site outright.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital rights group Fight for the Future has received &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a cease and desist order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comcastroturf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comcastroturf.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign likely funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s “valuable intellectual property.” The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is exactly why we need Title II net neutrality protections that ban blocking, throttling, and censorship,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“If Ajit Pai’s plan is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply blocking sites like Comcastroturf.com that are critical of their corporate policies,” &lt;b&gt;she added. &lt;/b&gt;“It also makes you wonder what Comcast is so afraid of? Are their lobbying dollars funding the astroturfing effort flooding the FCC with fake comments that we are encouraging Internet users to investigate?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal notice can be viewed &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; It claims that Comcastroturf.com violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See the case “&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/b&gt; which held that sites critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comcastroturf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comcastroturf.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC &amp;ndash; and as a result of the site at Comcastroturf.com, Fight for the Future &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has heard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with Comcastroturf.com, and also a long history of engaging in censorship,” &lt;b&gt;said Greer, &lt;/b&gt;“this is a perfect example of why we need bright line net neutrality rules that protect our free speech online, and why we can’t just trust Internet Service Providers to behave when they’ve abused their power time and time again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down Comcastroturf.com, and would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>FCC ignores growing evidence of fraud, moves ahead with plan to slash net neutrality protections</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 18, 2017&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;, 978-852-6457&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;New evidence raises even greater suspicion about flood of fraudulent anti-net neutrality comments. Numerous individuals have confirmed that personal information was used to file comments without their permission, data analysis shows likely connection to stolen databases.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the FCC voted to move ahead with its plan to slash net neutrality protections, despite overwhelming public outcry and growing evidence of serious fraud by net neutrality opponents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is calling on Internet users, the FCC, and state Attorneys General to investigate this potential case of mass identity fraud. The group has launched a website: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comcastroturf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comcastroturf.com&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; where Internet users can check if their personal information was used to file a comment without their permission and contact the authorities to request an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FCC is still refusing to release proof of an alleged DDoS attack that silenced voices in support of Title II net neutrality protections, and now there is significant evidence that a person or organization has been using stolen names and addresses to fraudulently file comments opposing net neutrality,”&lt;b&gt; said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,&lt;/b&gt; “If this FCC has any legitimacy, it simply cannot move forward until an investigation has been conducted. We need to know who is doing this, if Ajit Pai or other FCC officials knew that it was happening, and whether any of this illegal activity has been funded by companies like Comcast and Verizon who have a long history of financing astroturf groups. State Attorneys General should immediate investigate whether people in their state were affected by this, and the FCC should immediately release any and all information that it has about who is submitting these fake comments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here’s what we know:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Numerous&lt;/a&gt; media outlets have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that more than 450,000 suspicious comments &amp;ndash; all containing the same misleading rhetoric, many submitted in alphabetical order and in perfect formatting, opposing net neutrality protections &amp;ndash; have been submitted into the FCC’s docket. It seems extremely likely that a significant portion of these comments are completely fake, and were submitted using real people’s names and addresses without their permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journalists have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spoken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many people&lt;/a&gt; whose personal information was used to file an anti-net neutrality comment who confirmed that they never filed such a comment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15626278/net-neutrality-spam-bot-fcc-leak-data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Various&lt;/a&gt; security researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have noted&lt;/a&gt; that a significant portion of the suspicious anti-net neutrality comments use names and addresses found in breached databases including River City Media and Modern Business Solutions. Statistical analysis shows a much greater percentage of the anti-Title II comments use information found in leaked/stolen lists than other comments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fight for the Future directly interviewed more than a dozen people and confirmed that they had not filed the comments in question, nor had they signed any petitions that could conceivably have used that comment text. Our campaigner knocked on doors in her zipcode in Tampa, FL and spoke in person to several people whose information had been used to file a comment without their permission. We interviewed these people thoroughly and ensured that they understood the issue well enough that they could not have filed a comment and forgotten about it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-11-what-is-the-fcc-hiding-thousands-call-for-the/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has refused&lt;/a&gt; to show evidence for its claim that a DDoS attack took down their site during the exact same time that large numbers of pro net neutrality comments would have been flowing in from John Oliver’s segment on Last Week Tonight. Security experts and even a former senior FCC staffer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-11-what-is-the-fcc-hiding-thousands-call-for-the/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have disputed&lt;/a&gt; their unfounded claims, raising questions about whether the agency is actively trying to silence supporters of net neutrality while knowingly accepting fraudulent comments opposing it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fortune &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/05/15/net-netrality-comments-fcc-spam/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you remove the suspicious comments, 97% of the remaining comments are in support of Title II based net neutrality protections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2014, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/net-neutrality-is-marxist-according-to-this-koch-backed-astroturf-group&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; that a group allied with the cable &amp;amp; telecom lobby, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americancommitment.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Commitment&lt;/a&gt;, rented space on several email lists oriented towards older conservative voters and sent misleading emails soliciting comments to the FCC opposing net neutrality rules. Given the large number of comments they collected (~1 million) the cost of the list rentals would have been extremely high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/net-neutrality-email-american-commitment-116553&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported in Politico&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 that the American Commitment letter was submitted to members of Congress using suspicious, out-of-district addresses, including from constituents who didn’t recall sending such a message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The text of the misleading anti-net neutrality comment has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;been tied to&lt;/a&gt; the relatively unknown group Center for Individual Freedom. The group claims that they have been collecting signatures through an online web form, but that form does not appear on their website or social media. It would be extremely unusual, if not impossible, for a letter that is not visible on the web or social media to attract even tens of thousands of signers, much less hundreds of thousands. The only way to accomplish that would be to spend potentially tens of millions of dollars on list rentals and advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the alleged DDoS incident and the person or organization behind these likely fraudulent comments. Further, we encourage journalists to ask Cable companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fight for the Future launches its first A-Team to pass universal health care in New York, nationwide.</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;###&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, May 17, 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact: Holmes Wilson, press@fightforthefuture.org, 614-465-6371&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First A-Team sets out to secure a ground-breaking victory on universal health care in New York state&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is proud to announce the launch of its first A-Team, a program created to help activists launch special-ops teams for a new style of resistance activism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the New York Health Act (NYHA), the bill that would bring single-payer healthcare to all New York residents, passed the Assembly. Fight for the Future is supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://passnyhealth.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NY Health Act Now&lt;/a&gt;, a group created with A-Teams funding, that joined the fight in recent months.  They are building support for the Act through the power of the internet - web, social media, and grassroots campaigning. The group—made up of freelance film and media professionals who rely on the Affordable Care Act—met through a slack channel made up of people concerned about the attacks on the ACA following last November’s election. The group decided to get behind the New York Health Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Act would be the first of its kind and expand Medicare for all New York residents. The bill will now move on to the Senate and with only 35 days left in the legislative session, the members of NY Health Act Now are working feverishly to demonstrate overwhelming support for the bill in order to secure a victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trump seems determined to end Obamacare, so states like New York have millions of people they need to protect,” said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future, “But the best part is, this is an opportunity to pass something better and cheaper than Obamacare, making it a model for other states to follow, and using Trump’s onslaught to achieve long-overdue change—that’s why we’re so excited about this team.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill already has widespread support thanks to years of grassroots organizing largely coordinated by the statewide umbrella organization the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyhcampaign.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Campaign for New York Health&lt;/a&gt;, which has secured endorsements from hundreds of labor organizations, community groups, faith groups, businesses, and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are honored and excited to get the opportunity to join the incredible people fighting for healthcare reform in New York. With A-Team support, we can focus our energy on bringing coverage to all New York residents. We are New York. We&amp;rsquo;re progressive, we&amp;rsquo;re caring, and we have a higher GDP than Australia. We can lead the way on healthcare,” said Alexandra Rivera (Brooklyn, NY), co-founder of NY Health Act Now. Australia already has universal, single-payer healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/a&gt; was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year. They built the page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BattleForTheNet.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was responsible for more than ¼ of all the net neutrality comments received by the FCC during its feedback process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is best known for their role in the massive online protests against SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, and continues to organize many of the largest protests in the history of the Internet.

They partner with progressive organizations, public health groups, physicians groups and others to provide media content and communication strategy to bolster their efforts. To date, they have launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://passnyhealth.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;passnyhealth.com&lt;/a&gt;, launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://DearCuomo.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DearCuomo.com&lt;/a&gt; to write letters encouraging Gov. Cuomo to come out in support of the bill, and created tools for canvassers and local organizers to engage with businesses owners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
