# Product Director / Coder
(A UX Generalist, for defending the Internet)

We're working to innovate and build the open tech tools that amplify individual power for change and are the future of organizing to 1. Ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core and 2. To create the pathways and strategies that dismantle barriers set up by the status quo. We customize and build tech to win with very clear political goals and are looking for a talented, versatile, product developer or director to join a new effort: a mobile platform for organizing. We're looking for a strong product person who has an interest in changing the world by making apps and software that make people laugh, share, act, and hunger for more.

For anyone who cares about defending and transforming the future of tech or politics, this could be a dream job.  We're aiming to defend the Internet against bad tech and other policy and to mobilize the grassroots in that charge.  Think large public campaigns and social platforms aimed at a mass audience.  If you ever wanted to build platforms that reach out, grab people, and help them them change the world, then this is the job for you. 

This is crucial work, and we’re approaching it in the most fun and pioneering ways possible, with high-impact campaigns that resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power.  You will be on the front lines, building software millions of people see and interact with.  

We are looking for an individual who can help plan and execute our mobile and product development strategy for online engagement during the election season. If we decide to keep working together, your work will be to oversee our campaign tech strategies and online experiences. 

Ideally, you're an innovator of products for user engagement with the ability to code and/or have management experience. If you're all three, fantastic, but we are open to a product + developer or a product + manager person.

You should be well versed in current product innovations, messaging apps, social media, UI/UX, design, rapid protoyping and release, user adoption, and user testing, and be able to navigate or do a cost/benefits analysis of various technical solutions, coding languages, dev/ops, and architecture-based decisions.

You will help conceptualize, develop, build and/or manage our tech product strategy, taking our goal-oriented tech strategy through each phase of development with a team. You will oversee product development with the goal of meeting campaign metrics of reach, efficacy, and fundraising, which will include the assessment, research, developing specifications, directing design, and implementation of product plans. 

You should be able to think on your feet, be organized, optimize project plans and work load, manage/delegate the different pieces of projects and user growth. You should have smart, powerful ideas to share to reach product goals. You ideally understand online organizing and user growth strategies and can bring that into your work defining the product as well as gaining users in the real world.  We'd especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off technological tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal -- you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to build for the right audience.

We are open to contract-based work for our mobile strategy work this summer, or someone who would want to work in house to run the product side of our organization as a Product Manager in addition later down the road.

## If you are a product director + manager:

Project managers are skilled communicators and problems solvers who help our team to focus their efforts in the right places. You can expect to be working with us to leverage social networks, mobile applications, and more to help solve real world problems. 

Here's what we expect from someone in this role:
*	Create and execute project plans and revise as appropriate to meet changing needs and requirements.
*	Identify resources needed to complete individual tasks and assign responsibilities in conjunction with other key members of teams.
* Conduct check-ins and ensure requirements documents are up to date to communicate progress, demonstrate the operations of web products and collect feedback where appropriate.
* Manage project budget, monitor for overages and advises senior staff on impending budgetary events.
* Inspire confidence in others to attain goals and perform to the best of their ability.
* Identify opportunities for improvement, make constructive suggestions for change, and positively contribute to the culture of the company.
*	Mitigate conflict and communication problems by interceding when necessary.

Requirements:
* 2 plus years experience in integrating W3C, XHTML 1.0, CSS (table-less layouts), DHTML, AJAX, and advanced JavaScript. 
* UI intuition, attention to detail, and a solid understanding of browser performance and their various issues. 
* Deep understanding of design, usability, and performance.

## If you are a product director + coder:

You should be an agile programmer / hacker that can make things work and work well for millions of users at the same time while also being able to make smaller apps that work quickly and smoothly. If you can understand the scope of a problem and devise solid tech solutions on your own, you're the person we want to talk to. 

You don’t need to be an expert designer or have illustration skills.  If you can both faithfully implement others’ designs and make good decisions about layout, typography, and color when needed, that’s what we’re looking for.  It’s also important that you can build high quality user interaction with intuitive prompts, clear buttons, etc, spotting and fixing UI problems as you go.  

We’re looking for somebody who can bottom-line the creation of mobile platform, but who is also always using their full brain, putting themselves in a user or a reader’s shoes.  

You’ll be building things like:
* Tools and apps that get used over and over by our organization and others.
* Internet wide infrastructure for large, decentralized actions across a coalition of websites
* Solutions that achieve our goals by leveraging and customizing existing services (CRM, publishing tools, etc).
* Flawless HTML/CSS and clear, modern design that supports the message.  

Requirements:
* Experience building applications with a modern web framework like Django, Rails, or Node.js
* jQuery skills
* Ability to develop iOS / Android applications (learning as you go is okay)
* Experience managing large databases
* Experience in HTML/CSS with awareness of common cross-browser problems
* Proven ability to do clean and classy design
* Ability to make good UI/UX decisions and spot problems


## Things that you might like about this job:

* It’s telecommute work with a 100% remote team
* The work will be highly varied, like freelancing on a variety of projects
* You can choose the framework and tools we use to get stuff done (we have some commitment to Django right now, but could switch).
* We can give you a contractor budget to reduce/eliminate mundane work.  Responsibility for the final result is what matters.
* Be a hero to many.  The “yeah, I made that” small talk in bars is fun.

## Bonus points for:

* Having conceived and launched your own product
* Ability to build and manage teams
* Strong participation in communities like Reddit or HN
* Lots of remote / freelance experience solving problems on tight deadlines

## Mega bonus points for:

* Having started a successful open source project
* Having been a leader—of anything—especially online, especially tech-related
* Understanding and being able to hack on projects that push the limits of user freedom such as: TOR, Bitcoin, Bittorrent, GPG, OTR messaging, academic P2P work, etc. 

To apply, email a brief resume with links to your public repos, sample code (as many examples as possible) and good examples of UI, design, and/or HTML/CSS work to: [sarah@fightforthefuture.org](mailto:sarah@fightforthefuture.org) with the subject “Product Director”.

# Campaign Strategist Manager 

Our organization is focused on developing high-impact campaigns that resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power. The Campaign Manager/ Evangelist position is one of the most important roles in our work - it is central to the organization and its effectiveness. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job for you. We're looking for someone to continue to build that organization with us, from the ground up.

We're looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas; we're looking for someone who can speak to people's humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.

We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.

You should be able to think on your feet, be organized, optimize organizational and project plans and work load, manage/delegate the different pieces of a campaign (outreach, press, writing, product) and set up the organization for long term growth. You will also interface with others, so to some extent you should have smart, powerful ideas to share with others. You should understand and be able to express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.

We'd especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal -- you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.

We’re hiring for senior to mid-level campaigners who have experience with digital or traditional organizing but generally want to innovate to win.

We have several positions, so if you have skills and expertise with just one aspect of campaigning but truly excel at it -- from digital growth to on the ground activism -- we want to hear from you. 

## Desired Skills & Experience

* Writing for a large audience

* Running campaigns on high-impact issues

* Managing campaigns and responses to a fast-changing, dynamic field

* Working with a large variety of people, groups, and companies and spreading the message to as many stakeholders as possible

* Fighting against money in politics and heavily-funded lobbying teams

* Playing a key role in the planning and strategy of campaign organizing and organization growth

* Leading or starting a coalition

* Finding and securing new sources for campaigns

## You should also have experience

* Running online campaigns that grow fast

* Crafting exciting and persuasive actions

* Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility (including by talking with press)

* Fighting hard for something

## Bonus: Digital Growth Position available

* We're looking for individuals who are email list managers, deliverability experts, or social media growth experts for a Digital Manager role.
* You should be great at digital growth strategy, using CRM's and CMS', and social media. 
* You need to be meticulous at getting deliverability right and ambitious at developing ideas for digital growth and impact.

## Compensation

Market Rate / Commensurate with Experience
Full health and dental benefits
Office support

## Location

The team will be 100% remote-no need to commute or relocate. If you're interested in relocation, let us know. We'd start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.

## To apply

If you're interested, send links to work you've done to [sarah@fightforthefuture.org](mailto:sarah@fightforthefuture.org). Show us that you excel at the things we're looking for. If you like, include links to or samples of your writing--ideally in situations where you're writing to persuade a group of people too. Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you've done, projects you've worked on, etc. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don't exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren't activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).
