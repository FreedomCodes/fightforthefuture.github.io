<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<b><br/></b></p><p>June 15, 2016</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>July 23 event in Denver will launch multi-city roadshow featuring high profile performers and speakers to defeat dangerous, anti-democratic deal</i></h2><p></p><p>DENVER, CO––Legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave), popular punk band <b>Anti-Flag</b>, Golden Globe nominated actress <b>Evangeline Lilly</b> (Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man), Denver-based hip-hop outfit <b>Flobots</b>, and buzzworthy bi-lingual rockers <b>Downtown Boys </b>will perform at a free concert in Denver at Summit Music Hall on Saturday, July 23rd to mobilize opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. The event will kick off the Rock Against the TPP roadshow. Organized by Morello’s new label, <b>Firebrand Records</b> and digital rights group <b>Fight for the Future</b>, the roadshow features a nationwide series of activism-fueled music events designed to raise awareness about the dangers of the TPP and build opposition to the toxic deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors. The TPP has little to do with trade, but would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety.</p><p><b>See a full lineup and Rock Against the TPP tour dates here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">RockAgainstTheTPP.org</a></b> </p><p>Additional Rock Against the TPP tour dates and line-ups in other cities will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>“Working people everywhere have had enough,” <b>said Tom Morello,</b> “The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy. That’s why people are rising up to stop it. Corporate lobbyists want to sneak the TPP through Congress quietly; that means it’s time for us to get loud.”</p><p>“This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” <b>said Evangeline Lilly, </b>“Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, internet freedom, climate change, or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy. The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it. It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”</p><p>The <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> Tour is being organized by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, the viral Internet freedom group best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against online censorship and in favor of free speech and privacy. <a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/" target="_blank"><b>Firebrand Records</b></a>, the new social justice infused record label co-founded by Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey, is acting as the tour’s artistic partner.
