Diverse lineups vary per city &amp; include Tom Morello, Evangeline Lilly, Jolie Holland, Las Cafeteras, Anti-Flag, &amp; Flobots</i></h2><p>Internationally acclaimed hip-hop artist <b>Talib Kweli</b> will perform with a full live band at a free concert at <b>Showbox SoDo</b> in Seattle on August 19th to raise awareness about the dangers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, an anti-democratic “trade” deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors. The event is part of the <b><a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">Rock Against the TPP</a> </b>tour, a series of concerts, protests, and teach-ins organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future and Firebrand Records, the new activist record label from Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey. Today, the tour’s organizers also unveiled additional dates on July 30 in San Diego, CA, and August 20 in Portland, OR. The San Diego date features Jolie Holland and rising East LA Chicano band <b>Las Cafeteras</b>.

Activists, musicians, and celebrities are coming together to sound the alarm about the toxic deal, which has little to do with trade, but would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety.</p><p>The West Coast tour stops will also feature renowned rock cellist <b>Bonfire Madigan</b> <i>(Kill Rockstars, K Records)</i>, Firebrand Records artist <b>bell’s roar</b>, Puerto Rican vocalist <b>Taina Asili</b>, and Fight for the Future campaign director <b>Evan Greer,</b> the tour’s lead organizer.</p><p>“Working people everywhere have had enough,” <b>said Tom Morello,</b> “The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy. That’s why people are rising up to stop it. Corporate lobbyists want to sneak the TPP through Congress quietly; that means it’s time for us to get loud.”</p><p>“This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” <b>said Evangeline Lilly, </b>“Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, internet freedom, climate change, or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy. The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it. It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”</p><p>The <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> Tour is being organized by<b> <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a></b>, the viral Internet freedom group best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against online censorship and in favor of free speech and privacy. <b><a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/" target="_blank">Firebrand Records</a>,</b> the new social justice infused record label co-founded by Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey, is acting as the tour’s artistic partner.
