Some people have been asking us about blog posts that the Trichordist is writing about us. Fight for the Future has been the target of a lengthy series of posts aimed at misrepresenting our organization based on unsubstantiated claims. 
</p>
<p>
We want to present the facts on some of the more serious allegations they’ve raised. It’s clear that The Trichordist is no fan of our work, but we should be able to disagree on copyright policy without attacking each other. 
</p>
<h2>They suggested we committed a federal crime.</h2>
<p>
The Trichordist wrote that our campaign which helped people submit nearly 100,000 comments to the US Copyright Office may be a “denial of service” attack, suggesting we engaged in “fraudulent” activity with our <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a> site.
</p>
<p>
A denial of service attack would prevent people from using a web server for its intended purpose. The intended purpose of the Regulations.gov web server is to collect comments from individuals, and we <em>assisted</em> them in fulfilling that purpose by allowing the public to easily comment on an urgent matter. We did a much better job than the government’s IT staff apparently anticipated, and their server did crash, but to suggest this was cyber attack is just silly.
</p>
<p>
Going viral is not a federal crime.
</p>
<h2>They can’t decide whether we are robots or pre-teens.</h2>
<p>
The Trichordist’s posts alternate between complaining that these comments were generated by &ldquo;pre-teens&rdquo; and suggesting that Fight for the Future wrote a bot to fraudulently and automatically generate them. The former point is simply an ad-hominem attack against the huge number of people who took action. The latter is false.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a> website allowed people to quickly and easily submit comments to the Regulations.gov website. It launched a day before the comments were due, and quickly went viral thanks to our talented campaigners and our partnership with Channel Awesome on YouTube. In a period of just over 24 hours, nearly 100,000 people visited the site and submitted a comment using our form.
</p>
<p>
The people who took action on this campaign were real people, not robots, or “zombies” as was suggested by the CEO of Copyright Alliance. The comment form itself was editable. Many people added their own text on top of or below the template comment text we included by default, so even though common language may have been included, it&rsquo;s not safe to assume the comments were identical by running a simple text search.
</p>
<p>
See for yourself: we’ve released a small portion of the public comments at <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org/comments" target="_blank">www.takedownabuse.org/comments</a>.
</p>
<h2>They said we are a Google-funded astroturfing group with no evidence.</h2>
<p>
Fight for the Future is an independent public advocacy group with over a million members. We do not take money from Google and we do not campaign for them. We work every day to protect freedom of expression in the digital age. We have a board, we get donations and support from individuals and foundations. We go up against big content, big tech, big defense, and big cable on all different kinds of issues—we work to expand the public&rsquo;s power to shape the world around them, and to help ensure that the public is the leading voice in debates. Look at any and all of our campaigns. You can find information about our supporters on our web site at <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/supporters" target="_blank">www.fightforthefuture.org/supporters</a>.

<h2>They said we broke the rules of the regulations.gov website.</h2>
<p>
According to The Trichordist:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>
47,418 of the comments submitted by FFTF to the regulations.gov website did not disclose first and last name as required.
</li>
<li>
My test of the FFTF comment bot indicated that it accepted comments from IP addresses outside of the United States.
</li>
<li>
My test of the FFTF comment bot indicated that one could simply reload the page and post over and over again. Thus allowing fraudulent multiple comments.
</li>
<li>
My test of the FFTF comment bot indicated that it did not verify email addresses or names of those commenting and yet posted these comments to the regulations.gov website.
</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>
Our site simply forwarded comments to Regulations.gov in the same format as their own website did. All of these points are issues that you would encounter on the Regulations.gov website if submitting a comment directly. You can use a fake name or not include an email address. You can send a comment from outside of the U.S. (yes, U.S. copyright law affects people all over the world). You can reload the page and submit another comment. None of this indicates fraudulent activity on our part. <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-05-17-a-look-inside-the-closed-door-dmca-meetings/" target="_blank">We went the Copyright Office&rsquo;s hearings</a> on DMCA reform and met the regulators, and they never raised any concerns about these comments breaking their rules.
</p>
<h2>We should be able to disagree without attacking each other.</h2>
<p>
We’re disappointed that The Trichordist chose to launch unsubstantiated ad-hominem attacks against our organization, rather than engage us on the important issues we’re discussing. While we have significant ideological differences with many of the organizations and individuals who have been most vocal in the copyright debate, we respect the fact that there are a diverse array of public and private interests at stake, and try to conduct ourselves courteously.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, we&rsquo;re not even on different pages in terms of outcomes for artists—we just disagree on how to get there, and whether or not we should give big corporate copyright holders more control of people’s creative works in the policies governing freedom of expression.
