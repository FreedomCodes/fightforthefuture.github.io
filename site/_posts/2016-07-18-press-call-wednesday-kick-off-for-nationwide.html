<p>For Immediate Release: July 18, 2016      <br/>Contact: Matthew Groch, (202) 454-5111, <a href="mailto:mgroch@publiccitzen.org" target="_blank">mgroch@citzen.or</a>g</p><h2><i>Tour Headliners and Organizers Join Famed Pollster, Dr. Stanley Greenberg, with New Polling Data Spotlighting the Anti-corporate Trade Sentiment Galvanizing the Electorate</i></h2><p><b>WHAT: </b>This Wednesday July 20th at 1pm EST Golden Globe nominated actress <b>Evangeline Lilly </b>(Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man), popular punk band <b>Anti-Flag </b>frontman <b>Justin Sane</b>, Jonny 5 of the Denver-based hip-hop outfit <b>Flobots</b>, and famed political pollster <b>Dr. Stanley Greenberg</b>, will hold a press conference via phone for the kick-off of the nationwide <b><a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">Rock Against the TPP</a></b> tour, a series of large-scale concerts, teach-ins, and protests mobilizing to raise awareness about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Organized by legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> (<i>Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave)</i>, his new label, Firebrand Records and digital rights group Fight for the Future, the tour is sponsored by Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America, CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, and the Teamsters. This kick-off press call comes days before the first free concert in Denver at Summit Music Hall on Saturday, July 23rd. The tour’s organizers <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-07-04-talib-kweli-to-play-free-rock-against-the-tpp/" target="_blank">recently announced</a> </b>additional stops in San Diego, Seattle, and Portland, featuring high-profile performers like hip hop icon <b>Talib Kweli </b>and ANTI-records songwriter <b>Jolie Holland</b>. The TPP has little to do with trade but rather its core provisions would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety. While the artists will discuss the nationwide concert tour, Dr. Greenberg will reveal new polling data explaining the trans-partisan anger at corporate trade deals and examining what drives voter anger about trade deals like the TPP.          </p><p><b>WHEN:</b> 1 p.m. EST, Wednesday, July 20th</p><p><b>WHO: </b><br/>Evangeline Lilly, Actress (Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man, Hurt Locker)<br/>Justin Sane, Guitarist/Vocals, Anti-Flag<br/>Jonny 5, Flobots<br/>Evan Greer, Campaign Director, Fight for the Future, lead tour organizer<br/>Dr. Stanley Greenberg, Chairman/CEO, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research<br/>Lori Wallach, Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch</p><p><b>CALL-IN:</b> Please RSVP for Call-in Information </p><p><b>RSVP: </b>Please RSVP to mgroch@citizen.org</p><p><b>Upcoming Rock Against the TPP Dates:</b></p><p><b>July 23:</b> Denver, CO w/ Tom Morello, Anti-Flag, Evangeline Lilly, Flobots + more</p><p><b>July 30:</b> San Diego, CA w/ Jolie Holland, Evangeline Lilly, Bonfire Madigan + more</p><p><b>August 19:</b> Seattle, WA w/ Talib Kweli, Anti-Flag, Evangeline Lilly + more</p><p><b>August 20:</b> Portland, OR w/ Anti-Flag, Evangeline Lilly, Downtown Boys + more</p><p>Additional Shows TBD</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p>###</p>
