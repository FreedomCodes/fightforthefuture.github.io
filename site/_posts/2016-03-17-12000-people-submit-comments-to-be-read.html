Encryption protects our hospitals, airports, and water treatment facilities. Undermining security risks lives.” </p><p>Protesters who gathered outside of Apple stores and FBI headquarters last month <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-02-23-photos-protesters-at-apple-stores-in-40-cities/" target="_blank">carried</a> </b>giant iPhone shaped banners with the message “Secure Phones Save Lives,” echoing the concerns of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/03/469091056/tech-companies-security-experts-express-support-for-apple" target="_blank"><b>security experts</b></a> who largely agree that backdoors in encryption technology actually weaken national security and undermine public safety rather than strengthen it.</p><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a> is best known for organizing some of the<b> <a href="http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers" target="_blank">largest</a> </b>online protests in history, including the SOPA blackout against online censorship, <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><b>Reset the Net</b></a> to promote encryption and fight government surveillance, and the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><b>Internet Slowdown</b></a> for net neutrality.
