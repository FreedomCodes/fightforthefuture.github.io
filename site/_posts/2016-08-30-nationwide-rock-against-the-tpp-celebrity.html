The tour, which is the largest mobilization against the TPP in U.S. history, comes to Regency Ballroom from 6pm - 11pm for a FREE event featuring legendary hip hop duo <b>Dead Prez</b>, actress Evangeline Lilly <i>(Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man)</i> punk icon Jello Biafra, Grammy winning latin-alternative band <b>La Santa Cecilia</b>, riot-grrrl cellist Bonfire Madigan, and <b>Jeff Rosenstock</b> of popular ska band Bomb the Music Industry. </p><p><b>See more details and a full lineup here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/san-francisco-ca" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/san-francisco-ca</a></b></p><p>The concert will be followed by a teach-in on “How to Fight the TPP” on Saturday, Sep 10th from 1pm - 3pm at 1999 Bryant Street, hosted by experts from a wide range of organizations opposing the TPP.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Organized by digital rights group <b>Fight for the Future</b> in partnership with legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer <b>Ryan Harvey</b>’s record label Firebrand Records  previous stops on the tour have featured high-profile participants including <b>Talib Kweli</b>, comedian <b>Hari Kondabolu</b>, legendary punk band Anti-Flag, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation <b>Chumbawamba</b>, Adult Swim comedian <b>Eric Andre</b>, and ANTI records songwriter <b>Jolie Holland</b>. The roadshow has already drawn large crowds in Denver, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland.</p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, </b>“we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers. Organizers plan to announce additional dates to the tour soon.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Additional performers at the September 9th event include SF indie rock darlings Built for the Sea, Taina Asili, Ryan Harvey, Evan Greer, bell’s roar, and local hip hop emcee Raw-G.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/photos-video-massive-crowd-giant-blimp-protests-trans-pacific-partnership-at-rock-against-the-1733f9ed1fa1#.xkq7oohiw" target="_blank"><b>SEE PHOTOS AND VIDEO AVAILABLE FOR USE BY PRESS HERE.</b></a></p><p>For Interviews with Artists or Organizers, please contact Evan Greer at <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or (978) 852-6457.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p># # #</p>
