  <p>Fight for the Future is dedicated to expanding the Internet's
    transformative power for good. Our goal: to build a grassroots movement to
    ensure that everyone can access the Internet’s many resources affordably,
    free of interference or censorship and with full privacy. Our vision: a
    world where everyone can enjoy the basic freedom to express, create and
    connect online.</p>  <br/>

  <p>Our organization is nimble and can react quickly to current events, and our
    staff is a unique combination of talented technologists, educators,
    organizers, advocates and artists. Working with our many allies in the
    non-profit and tech sectors, we launch campaigns that frequently go viral
    and engage virtually every demographic. We frame our messages in ways that
    make people understand and care about even the most technical issue. We also
    provide them with online tools that make it easy and compelling to take
    action and share with friends.</p>  <br>
  <img src="/img/page/aboutus/theory.png" style="float:left">

  <p>We believe that we can turn Internet users around the world into empowered
    and informed agents for change. By bringing individuals together so that
    they identify as a unified Internet constituency, and by providing them with
    the tools to amplify their collective voice we know that the best outcome
    will prevail in any policy debate.</p>  <br>
  <img src="/img/page/aboutus/issues.png" style="float:left">

  <p>We view the following as the major threats to freedom of expression
    online: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Copyright and patent laws are outdated and overzealous.</strong>
      They hurt artists and innovation, shifting control of our art, media, and
      ideas to large corporations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Slow speed and limited access:</strong> Lack of competition in
      the U.S. broadband market has resulted in an Internet system that is among
      the slowest, most expensive and least available among developed nations.
    </li>
    <a name="impact" href="#"></a>
    <li><strong>Tracking and Spying: </strong>People can’t express themselves
      freely online when they feel like they are being watched. In an extreme
      form, government and corporate surveillance can lead to political
      repression.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br> <img src="/img/page/aboutus/impact.png" style="float:left">

  <p>Fight for the Future is known for its powerful and massive viral organizing
    campaigns that have changed Internet history both nationally and globally.
    Under a campaign to stop SOPA and PIPA — the largest and most visible online
    protest in history — hundreds of thousands of websites, including sites like
    Google, Craigslist and Wikipedia, joined the protest by going dark or
    prominently displaying info on the bills. Ultimately, 24 million people took
    action against bad tech policy, and both bills were shelved.</p>

  <p>Our SOPA strike inspired street protests across Europe against the
    Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) — another attack on digital
    rights — and led to ACTA’s historic defeat. In 2012, we also helped to stall
    out the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) written
    ostensibly to prevent threats to cybersecurity, but written so broadly that
    it could easily be used for government spying and censorship. For the last
    election, we created a slate of voter registration and get-out-the-vote apps
    which gave the grassroots access to the tools that typically only large
    presidential campaigns can afford, diluting the power and influence of
    SuperPACs. And last November, public outcry from our campaign contributed to
    the rejection of a treaty that would have moved Internet governance to a
    top-down United Nations agency that operates behind closed doors and under
    corporate influence.</p>  <br>

    details on these and other accomplishments, check out a timeline of the
    events leading up to and immediately after the SOPA strike. </a> <br> <br>
