## A bill that would ban encryption in the U.S. is about to be introduced

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/action-network/encryption.jpg)

A proposed bill that’s about to hit the senate floor would [reverse](http://recode.net/2016/04/14/the-tech-community-is-mobilizing-against-the-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill/) current digital security technologies instead of protecting our sensitive data and physical safety. Besides behind prohibitively [costly](http://recode.net/2016/04/14/the-tech-community-is-mobilizing-against-the-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill/), security experts are [saying](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/senates-draft-encryption-bill-privacy-nightmare/) this is one of the most “ridiculous, technologically illiterate, and outright dangerous pieces of legislation that Congress has cooked up. Ever.”

Encryption protects not just our virtual lives but also our hospitals, airports and power plants. Tell Congress: “Encryption keeps us safe. Vote no on ANY bill that would weaken security or require government backdoors.”
