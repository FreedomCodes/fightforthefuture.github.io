![Democracy and the TPP](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/sites/sbs.com.au.news/files/styles/body_image/public/gettyimages-508176728.jpg?itok=xwjraOu4&mtime=1454570870)

Tech experts from [every](https://www.stopfasttrack.com/#orgs) major advocacy group working to defend Internet users’ rights vehemently oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, but a trade association that represents major web companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Uber just [endorsed](https://internetassociation.org/033016tpp/) it. 

The TPP was negotiated in complete [secrecy](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/08/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-irony) by government bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists from industries that hate the [Internet](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150605/11483831239/revealed-emails-show-how-industry-lobbyists-basically-wrote-tpp.shtml)––including the ones that wrote terrible censorship bills like [SOPA](http://sopastrike.com). It’s great for incumbent corporations, but terrible for individual internet users, startups, and the tech economy as a whole.

The TPP would:
*[Expand](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/02/03/tpp-problematic-partnership/) draconian copyright enforcement, undermining our privacy and the public domain without ensuring protections for free speech;
*[Criminalize](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/new-infographic-tpp-and-your-digital-rights) common practices like tinkering with or modifying devices, even for fair use purposes;
*[Enable](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/leaked-tpp-investment-chapter-reveals-serious-threat-user-safeguards) multi-national corporations to skirt the democratic process and use shadowy international tribunals to undermine Web users’ rights;
*[Set a precedent](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/06/clock-ticking-time-bomb-blow-up-free-internet-tpp) that will encourage anti-Internet lobbyists like the ones who wrote SOPA to use trade agreements to push for bad Internet policy.

There are powerful interests pushing to get the TPP passed through U.S. Congress, and it seems like they managed to pull a fast one on these Internet companies and get them to take a position that goes directly against their own interests and the interests of their users. 

Congress could vote on the TPP within a matter of weeks, and they’ll be watching closely how the public reacts to these companies’ statement.

If enough of us speak out, we can get these companies to drop their support for this dangerous agreement, and stand up for the rights of their users and the future of the Internet we all love. **Please sign the petition and share this widely right now.**
