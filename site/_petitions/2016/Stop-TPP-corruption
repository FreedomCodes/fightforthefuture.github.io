The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a secretive pact between the US and 11 other countries that would let multinational corporations override national sovereignty and violate people’s rights like never before. Now Congress and President Obama are trying to pass it during the post-election “lame duck” session. 

They call it a “free trade” deal, but only a small fraction of the TPP’s 5,544 pages deal with traditional trade issues like tariffs and quotas. The rest is packed with special-interest handouts and new ways for corporations to challenge democratically-passed policies.

At the heart of the TPP is an insane tribunal system that multinational corporations could use to secure taxpayer-funded payouts from TPP countries that pass laws or regulations that they believe may limit their profits. These tribunals would be staffed by private lawyers who would be allowed to rotate between serving as arbitration judges and working as advisors to the corporations bringing the cases to the tribunal. 

And then there are thousands of pages of provisions that threaten good-paying jobs, Internet freedom, access to medicine, environmental protections, public health, and much more. Many of these provisions come from the wish lists of special interests that weren’t able to get their policies passed through the regular legislative process. 

For example, SOPA, the web censorship bill that was defeated by the historic Internet blackout protest, has been resurrected in the TPP. Other anti-democratic “zombie” proposals in the TPP include limits on competition for pharmaceutical companies, increased fracking through automatic approval of gas exports, and lower food safety standards in the US by allowing big food companies to import meat and seafood from countries with lenient inspection practices.

The TPP was born out of corruption. It was written in secret by corporate lobbyists and government officials, and no public-interest groups, academics, or policy experts without ties to industry were allowed to see or comment on the text. Even members of Congress were blocked from participating in the process. Whether or not you support free trade, allowing giant corporations to hijack the process and write the text is no way to conduct democracy.
