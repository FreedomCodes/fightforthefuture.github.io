### The largest corporate power grab in history

The TPP is secretive pact between the US and 11 other countries that would give multinational corporations new powers to override national sovereignty and violate people’s rights. Now Congress and President Obama are trying to pass it during the post-election “lame duck” session. 

They call it a “free trade” proposal, but only 5 of the TPP’s 29 chapters actually deal with trade issues. The rest of the 5,544-page [text](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text) is packed with special-interest handouts and new ways for multinationals to challenge democratically-passed policies.

At the heart of the TPP is the creation of a new [tribunal system](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2016/06/Foreign_Investor_Protections_TPP.pdf) that multinational corporations could use to win taxpayer-funded compensation from TPP countries that pass laws or regulations that they believe limit their potential for profits. These tribunals would be decided by private lawyers who would be allowed to rotate between serving as arbitration judges and working as advisors to the corporations bringing the cases to the tribunal. 

And then there are thousands of pages of provisions straight from the wish lists of special interests that weren’t able to get their policies passed through the regular legislative process. These provisions threaten [good-paying jobs](http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/16-01Capaldo-IzurietaTPP.pdf), [Internet freedom](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp), [access to medicine](http://www.msfaccess.org/spotlight-on/trans-pacific-partnership-agreement), [environmental protections](http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/trans-pacific-partnership), and much more. 

For example, [copyright notice-and-takedown procedures](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/02/03/tpp-problematic-partnership/) similar to SOPA, the web censorship bill that was defeated by the historic Internet blackout protest, has been resurrected in the TPP. Other anti-democratic “zombie” proposals in the TPP include limits on competition for pharmaceutical companies, [increased fracking](http://www.ibtimes.com/trans-pacific-partnership-tpp-will-make-it-easier-export-us-natural-gas-japan-2129832) through automatic approval of gas exports, and lower [food safety](http://www.citizen.org/tpp-food-safety-facts) standards in the US by allowing big food companies to import meat and seafood from countries with lenient inspection practices.

The TPP was negotiated and written in secret by hundreds of corporate lobbyists and government officials. No public-interest groups, academics, or policy experts without industry ties were allowed to view the working text or participate in the process. 

The people working on the deal say they needed to keep the details secret (from everyone except the lobbyists that were let in) so they wouldn't undercut their negotiators. 

We get that. But if reaching a deal requires undermining national sovereignty in 12 countries 
and giving special interests a plethora of policies that have already been rejected through the representative lawmaking process, we don’t want it.
