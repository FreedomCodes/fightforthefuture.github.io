  We're calling on House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte to take up
  the SPEAK FREE Act immediately. Free speech on the Internet needs to be
  protected from bogus lawsuits.

  Companies and powerful individuals are using bogus “strategic lawsuits against
  public participation,” or SLAPP suits, to intimidate people into taking down
  their negative reviews. These lawsuits have no legal merit. They are simply
  ways for powerful entities to threaten and intimidate people into submission.

## Okay, Okay… we’re not actually going to sue you if you say something bad about us. But that's exactly what’s happening to people who post negative comments on Yelp, Airbnb, and other sites. 

Companies and powerful individuals are using bogus “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP suits, to intimidate people into taking down their negative reviews. These lawsuits have no legal merit. They are simply ways for powerful entities to threaten and intimidate people into submission. 

This is censorship at its worst. 

The Internet makes it easier for people to speak their minds. It makes it easier for people to question power and challenge the establishment. It’s a great thing for millions of people, but for some business owners and public figures, it means they may have to be accountable. And they hate that. 

Some states have already passed laws to make it easier for judges to dismiss these bogus SLAPP lawsuits so that their victims don’t get tied up in time consuming and costly litigation. We think it’s time for Congress to pass federal law to ensure that no one who exercises their free speech on the Internet has to go through a lengthy legal process to defend themselves.
