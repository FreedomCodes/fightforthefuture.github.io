## Okay, Okay… we’re not actually going to sue you if you say something bad about us. But this is exactly what’s happening to people who post negative comments on Yelp, Airbnb, and other sites.

Companies and powerful individuals are using bogus “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP suits, to intimidate people into taking down their negative reviews. These lawsuits have zero legal merit. They are simply ways for powerful entities to threaten and intimidate people into submission. 

This is censorship at its worst. The Internet makes it easier for people to speak their minds. It makes it easier for people to question power and challenge the establishment. It’s a great thing for millions of people, but for some business owners and public figures, it means they may have to be accountable. They hate that. 

Some states have already passed laws to make it easier for judges to dismiss these bogus SLAPP lawsuits so that their victims don’t get caught up in time consuming and costly litigation. It’s time for Congress to pass a federal law to ensure that no one who exercises their free speech on the Internet has to go through a lengthy legal process to defend themselves from bogus SLAPP suits.

**Here are a few examples of people who have been SLAPPed for expressing their opinions online:**

- Michell Duchouquette, [sued](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/05/04/yelp-review-could-cost-couple-1-million/) by Prestigious Pets for a Yelp review: "I don't think it was hateful, it didn't have bad intent, it's my opinion of a business. When I say it out loud saying I'm getting sued up to $1 million over this review, I can't believe it."
- Jennifer Ujimori, [sued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/negative-yelp-review-of-dog-obedience-class-spurs-lawsuit/2015/03/25/eb92dab6-d183-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html) by Burke's Dog Tranquility over Angie's List and Yelp reviews: "People should be free to express their feelings about their service providers. Companies using the legal system to silence their critics has a chilling effect on First Amendment rights."
- Matthew White, [sued](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/yelp-slapp-lawsuit-legislation-speak-free-act) by Footprints Floors for a Yelp review: "People should not be threatened or have to pay a lot of money in attorney fees just because they relay a real-life experience. So what Amanda and I want to do is turn something that was very negative and costly for us into something positive for others."
- T. [was threatened](https://consumerist.com/2014/05/08/how-does-a-negative-amazon-review-result-in-threats-of-a-lawsuit/) with a lawsuit for leaving a one-star review on Amazon: "I just wanted to leave a review with information that I found useful for others who have to decide whether to purchase a product, and not have to worry about being threatened by lawyers. It makes me really nervous to leave a negative review in the future. At the very least I'll never use my real name when posting a review ever again."
